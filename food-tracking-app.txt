Food Tracking App

A full-stack web application that allows users to track their food intake by uploading images, recognizing food items with AI, and logging nutrition data. The app uses React for the frontend, Express and MongoDB for the backend, and integrates with Clarifai for image recognition and USDA for nutrition data.

Features
- User authentication (register/login)
- Image upload and preview
- AI-powered food recognition
- Portion size selection
- Nutrition data retrieval (cached for efficiency)
- Food log creation and management
- History view with edit/delete options

Database Models

User Model
- _id
- name
- email
- password (hashed with bcrypt)
- createdAt
- settings (optional: units preference, dietary goals)

FoodLog Model
- _id
- userId (reference to User)
- imageUrl (Cloudinary URL)
- foodName
- portionSize
- calories
- protein
- carbs
- fats
- fiber
- otherNutrients (optional)
- confidence (AI confidence score)
- createdAt
- mealType (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack - optional)

FoodDatabase Model (Optional - cache USDA data)
- _id
- foodName
- nutritionPer100g { calories, protein, carbs, fats, fiber }
- usdaId
- lastUpdated

Step-by-Step Architecture

STEP 1: User Authentication
Frontend (React): Login/Register pages, form validation, JWT token storage
Backend (Express): /api/auth/register, /api/auth/login, /api/auth/me
Database: User model with hashed passwords (bcrypt)
Middleware: authMiddleware.js to protect routes

STEP 2: Image Upload Flow
Frontend: File input, image preview, upload button
Backend Route: /api/upload/image (multer middleware, Cloudinary upload)
Why Cloudinary? Free tier, easy integration, image optimization

STEP 3: Food Recognition (Clarifai)
Backend Route: /api/food/identify
Process: Receive image URL, call Clarifai API, return top predictions

STEP 4: Portion Selection (Frontend)
UI: Show identified food, dropdown/buttons for portion, confirm button

STEP 5: Nutrition Data (USDA API)
Backend Route: /api/food/nutrition
Process: Check cache, call USDA API if needed, calculate nutrition, cache for future

STEP 6: Save Food Log
Backend Route: /api/foodlog/create
Process: Receive data, create FoodLog document, save to MongoDB

STEP 7: View History
Backend Route: /api/foodlog/history
Process: Query FoodLog model, return paginated results
